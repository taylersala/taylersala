Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a student at Bloomtech, aiming to complete my course by December. Iâ€™ve been building a strong foundation in JavaScript, React.js, Redux, Node.js, Express, SQL, and more, with my primary focus on JavaScript and React.

Alongside coding, Iâ€™m developing skills in Agile Project Management, debugging, and software architecture, while also gaining experience with tools like Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop.

Currently, Iâ€™m working on my school labs and developing a fashion-focused application that allows users to upload clothes and build outfits. This app is designed for fashion enthusiasts who want an organized way to style outfits without the hassle of sorting through their closets. I plan to complete the project by March and feature it in my portfolio.

Iâ€™m passionate about e-commerce and love using code to bring businesses to the next level. My background in graphic design complements my development skills, allowing me to create visually appealing and highly functional user experiences. Being able to merge my design expertise with my love of coding is what excites me most about working in tech.

While Iâ€™m hyper-focused on wrapping up my time at BloomTech, over the next few months, I also plan to dive into additional personal projects, which will be showcased in my pinned section as I complete them.

In addition, Iâ€™m working toward earning new certifications and completing the Odin Project to further strengthen my skills. Iâ€™m always open to learning opportunities, so feel free to share any recommendations for courses, projects, or certifications!
