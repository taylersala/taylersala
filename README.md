Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm currently a student at Bloomtech, aiming to complete my course by December. I have been building foundational knowledge in JavaScript, React.js, Redux, Node.js, Express, SQL, and more, with a primary focus on JavaScript and React.

Alongside coding, Iâ€™m developing skills in Agile Project Management, debugging, and software architecture, while also working with tools like Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop.

Currently, I'm working on my labs for school and developing a fashion-focused application that allows users to upload clothes and build outfits. This app is designed for fashion enthusiasts who want a more organized way to style outfits without the hassle of sorting through their closets. I plan to complete the project by March and showcase it in my portfolio.

Over the next few months, I plan to earn additional certifications and complete the Odin Project to further strengthen my skills. I'm always open to new learning opportunities and any recommendations for courses, projects, or certifications!
